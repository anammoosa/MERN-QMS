    # Proxy API requests to the Gateway if needed (optional if using absolute URLs in client)
    # But for a proper setup, Nginx often proxies /api to the backend.
    # However, since the client code likely points to http://localhost:8002 via ENV vars,
    # we might strictly serve static files here.
    # We'll stick to static serving for now as Gateway exposes 8002 separately.
